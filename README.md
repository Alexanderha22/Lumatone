## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the lumatone midi keyboard. This keyboard will have 280 keys each with a corresponding linear hall effect sensor to measure the velocity of each keypress. The keypress data will be processed using an Arduino nano and the data will be sent using midi over USB. 

## Educational Value Added

This project will teach 3d modeling and printing techniques with a focus on splitting a large model into smaller, printable parts. This project will also use nearly 300 hall effect sensors to measure each keypress. These signals will have to be consolidated using analog multiplexers and multi-channel A2D converters which will improve circuit design. 

## BOM + Component Cost

Nearly all of the components for this project have already been bought including the 3d-printer filament. The remaining cost of this project comes from the post-processing of the parts using sandpaper and the soldering materials to connect the components. This should be at most $20.
